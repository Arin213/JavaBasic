/** 2) Create a class and name it Bed. Five private member variables should be declared: style of type String,
 and pillows, height, sheets, quilt of type int. A constructor should be coded which accepts
 these five member variables as parameters. Also, six methods should be defined: make()
 has no return type and prints a message to the effect that the bed is being made; getStyle()
 which returns the value of style; getPillows() returns the number of pillows; getHeight() returns
 the height of the bed; getSheets() returns the number of sheets on the bed; and getQuilt() returns the value of quilt.
