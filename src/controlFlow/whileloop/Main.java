           When to use do while?
           â†’ If there's a scenario where you must execute a piece of code
           at least once before checking a condition, a do-while loop is perfect.
           For example:

           User Input Validation: You want to prompt the user for input and then validate it.
           The prompt should appear at least once, and if the input is invalid, ask again.
