/** Diagonal Star

 Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number.

 If the number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".

 The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*).
 This should be achieved by using loops (see examples below).

 EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

 EXAMPLE 1

 printSquareStar(5); should print the following:

 â†’ NOTE: For text in Code Blocks below, use code icon {...}  On Udemy

 * * *

 *****


 Explanation:

 *****   5 stars
 ** **   2 stars space 2 stars
 * * *   1 star space 1 star space 1 star
 ** **   2 stars space 2 stars
 *****   5 stars


 EXAMPLE 2

 printSquareStar(8); should print the following:

 ********
 **    **
 * *  * *
 *  **  *
 *  **  *
 * *  * *
 **    **
 ********


 The patterns above consist of a number of rows and columns (where number is the number of rows to print).
 For each row or column, stars are printed based on four conditions (Read them carefully):

 In the first or last row

 In the first or last column

 When the row number equals the column number

 When the column number equals rowCount - currentRow + 1 (where currentRow is current row number)


 HINT: Use a nested loop (a loop inside a loop).

 HINT: To print on the same line, use the print method instead of println, e.g., System.out.print(" ");
 prints a space and does not "move" to another line.

 HINT: To "move" to another line, you can use an empty println call, e.g., System.out.println();.

 NOTE: The method printSquareStar should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
